- Control-plane component of network layer
	- Network wide logic that controls not only how a datagram is forwarded among routers, but also how network-layer components and services are configured and managed

- Traditionally, control-plane routing protocols have been implemented together with data-plane forwarding functions, monolithically, within a router
- Software-defined networking (SDN) makes a clear separation between the data and control planes

## Introduction

2 Possible Approaches to Forwarding
1. Per-routing control
2. Logically centralized control

- The controller interacts with a control agent (CA) in each of the routers via a well-defined protocol to configure and manage the router's flow table
- Google uses SDN to control the routers in its internal B4 global wide-area network
- SWAN, from Microsoft, uses a logically centralized controller to manage routing and forwarding between a wide area network and a data centre network

## Routing Algorithms

- A good path is one that has the least cost
- Routing algorithms that compute these paths are a fundamental importance
- Graph, $G = (N, E)$ is a set of $N$ nodes and a collection $E$ of edges, where each edge is a pair of nodes from $N$

- An edge cost may reflect the physical length, link speed, monetary cost
- A natural goal of routing algorithm is to identify the least costly paths between sources and destinations
- The least cost problem
	- Find a path between the source and destination that has the least cost
	- Also called the shortest path

Classifying Routing Algorithms
- Centralized
	- Least-cost path between source and destination using complete, global knowledge about the network
	- Algorithms with global state information are often referred to as link-state (LS) algorithm
- Decentralized
	- Least-cost path carried out in an iterative, distributed manner by the routers
	- Only knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links
	- Distance-vector (DV) algorithm

- Static
	- Routes change very slowly over time
	- Result of human intervention
- Dynamic
	- Change the routing paths as the network traffic loads or topology change
	- Run periodically or in direct response to topology or link cost changes

- Load-sensitive
	- Link costs vary dynamically to reflect the current level of congestion in the underlying link
- Load-insensitive
	- Link's cost does not explicitly reflect its current level of congestion
	- Used in todays internet


### The Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm

- Link-state broadcast algorithm
- Each node can run the LS algorithm and compute the same set of least-cost paths as every other node
- Dijkstra's algorithm
	- Related to Prim's algorithm
	- Computes the least-cost path from one node to all other nodes
	- Iterative and has the property that after the kth iteration, the least-cost paths are known

$D(v)$ - cost of the least-cost path from the source node to destination $v$ as of this iteration of the algorithm

$p(v)$ - previous node along the current least-cost path from the source to $v$

$N'$ - subnet of nodes


**Link-State (LS) Algorithm for Source node u**

```c
// Initialization
N' = {u}
	for all nodes v
		if v is a neightbour of u
			then D(v) = c(u, v)
				else D(v) = ∞

// Loop
	Find w not in N' such that D(w) is a minimum
	add w to N'
	update D(v) for each neighbour v of w and not in N':
		D(v) min(D(v), D(w) + c(w, v))
until N' = N
```

- $n$ nodes not counting the source
- In the first iteration, search though all $n$ nodes
- In the second iteration, $n-1$
- Total number of nodes to search is $n(n+1)/2$
- Preceding implementation of the LS algorithm has worst-case complexity of order $n$ squared or $O(n^2)$

**Prevent Oscillations**
- Mandate that link costs not depend on the amount of traffic
- Ensure not all routers run the LS algorithm at the same time
	- Internet can self-synchronize among themselves (Floyd Synchronization)

### The Distance-Vector (DV) Routing Algorithm

- LS algorithm is uses global information
- Distance-vector (DV) algorithm is iterative, asynchronous, and distributed
- It is distributed in that each node receives some information from one or more of its directly attached neighbours, performs a calculation, and then distributes the results of its calculation back to its neighbours
- Iterative until no more information is exchanged between neighbours
- Asynchronous, does not require all of the nodes to operated in lockstep with each other
- $d_x(y)$ is the cost of the least-cost path from node x to node y
- Bellman-Ford equation

$d_x(y)=min_v{c(x, y)+d_v(y)}$

- $min_v$ is the taken over all of x's neighbours

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251220161341.png" alt="image" width="500">
$d_{source}(dest)$
$d_v(z)$ = 5
$d_x(z)$ = 3
$d_w(z)$ = 3

$c(u, v) = 2$
$c(u, x) = 1$
$c(u, w) = 5$

$d_u(z)=min(2+5, 5+3, 1+3)=4$

- The result is the same as the Dijkstra algorithm
- Each node x begins with $D_x(y)$, an estimate of the cost of the least-cost path from itself to node y, for all nodes in N
- $D_x=[D_x(y): y in N]$ is the node x's distance vector
- For each neighbour v, the cost $c(x, v)$ from x to directly attached neighbour v
- Node x's distance vector $D_x$, containing x's estimate of its cost to all destinations, y in N
- The distance vector of each of its neighbours, that $D_v$ for each neighbour v of x

- From time to time, each nodes sends a copy of its distance vector to each of its neighbours
- When a node x receives a new distance, it saves it, then uses the Bellman-Ford equation to update its own distance vector

$D_x(y)=min(c(y, v) + D_v(y)$

- If the node distance has changed, node x will send its updated distance vector to each of its neighbours

**Distance-Vector (DV) Algorithm**

```c
// Init
for all destinations y in N:

```

- A node x updates its distance vector estimate when it either sees a cost change in one of its directly attached links or receives a distance vector update from some neighbour
- LS algorithm is a centralized algorithm, that requires each node to first obtain a complete map of the network before running the Dijkstra algorithm
- DV is decentralized and does not use global information
- DV-like algorithms are used in Internet's RIP and BGP, ISP IDRP, Novell IPX, and original ARPAnet

- Leftmost column of the figure displays 3 initial routing tables for each of the three nodes

$Dx=[Dx(x),Dx(y),Dx(z)]=[0,2,7]$

- After initialization, each node sends its distance vector to each of its two neighbours
- Node x sends its distance vector $D_x=[0, 2, 7]$ to both nodes y and z
- Each node recomputes its own distance vector

$Dx(x)=0$
$Dx(y)=min{c(x,y)+Dy(y),c(x,z)+Dz(y)}=min{2+0, 7+1}=2$
$Dx(z)=min{c(x,y)+Dy(z),c(x,z)+Dz(z)}=min{2+1,7+0}=3$

- The second, column displays for each node, the new distance vector along with vectors just received from its neighbours
- The process of receiving updated distance vector from neighbours, recomputing routing tables entries, and informing neighbours of changed costs of the least-cost path to a destination continues until no update messages are send

**Distance-Vector Algorithm: Link-Cost Changes and Link Failure**

- Only two iterations are required for the DV algorithm to reach quiescent state


<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251226145319.png" alt="image" width="500">

A
- Link cost from y to x changes from 4 to 1
B
- Link cost increases
	- Before link cost change, y detects the link cost change and computes its new min-cost path to x
	- A routing loop is like a black hole
		- A packet destined for x arriving at y or z as of $t_1$ will bounce back and forth between two nodes forever
	- Referred to as the count-to-infinity problem

**Distance-Vector Algorithm: Adding Poisoned Reverse**
- Looping can be avoided using a technique known as poisoned reverse
- If z routes through y to get to destination x, then z will advertise to y that is distance to x is infinity
- Loops involving three of more nodes will not be detected by the poisoned reverse technique

**A Comparison of LS and DV Routing Algorithms**
- DV and LS algorithms take complementary approaches toward computing routing
- DV
	- Each nodes only take to its neighbour
- LS
	- Requires global information

1) Message complexity
2) Speed of convergence
3) Robustness

- Neither algorithm is an obvious choice, both are used in the internet

## Intra-AS Routing in the Internet: OSPF

Simplistic View of Routing
- Scale
	- Overhead involved in communicating, computing, and storing routing information becomes prohibitive
	- A DV algorithm that iterated among large number of routers would never converge
- Administrative autonomy
	- Internet is a network of ISPs
	- ISP desires to operates its network as it pleases or to hide internal organization

- These problems are solved by organizing routers into autonomous systems (ASs), with each AS consisting of a group of routers that are under the same admin control
- Some tier-1 ISPs use one AS for their entire network, others break ISP into tens of interconnected AS
- AS numbers are assigned by ICANN regional registries
- Routers within the same AS all run the same routing algorithm and have information about each other
- Routing algorithms within AS are called an intra-autonomous system routing protocol

**Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**
- IS-IS are widely used for intra-AS routing
- Open in OSPF indicates that the routing protocol specification is publicly available
	- Cisco's EIGRP
- OSPF is a link-state protocol that uses flooding of link-state information and a Dijkstra's least-cost path algorithm
- Each router constructs a complete topological map (graph) of the entire AS
- Each router locally runs Dijkstra's to determine tree to all subnets
- Individual link costs are configured by the network admin

**Setting OSPF Link Weights**
- In order to achieve the goal of minimizing the max link utilization, the operator must find the set of link weights that achieves this goal

- A router broadcasts routing information to all other routers in the autonomous system, not just to its neighbours

Advances of OSPF
1. Security
2. Multiple same-cost paths
3. Integrated support for unicast and multicast routing
4. Support for hierarchy within a single As

## Routing Among the ISPs: BGP

- Routing a packet between a source and destination within the same AS is determined by the intra-AS routing protocol
- Across multiple AS uses inter-autonomous system routing protocol
	- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- BGP is the most important of the all internet protocols
- Decentralized and asynchronous protocol

### The Role of BGP

- Every router has a forwarding table
- In BGP, packets are not routed to a specific destination, instead CIDRized prefixes, with each prefix representing a subnet or a collection of subnets

BGP
1. Obtain prefix reachability information from neighbouring ASs
2. Determine the best routes to the prefixes


### Advertising BGP Route Information

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251227143258.png" alt="image" width="500">

- AS3 includes a subnet with prefix x
- Each router is either a gateway router or an internal router
- A gateway router is a router on the edge of an AS that directly connects to one or more routers
- An internal router connects only to hosts and routers within its own AS
- Pairs of routers exchange routing information over semi-permanent TCP connections using port 179
- Each TCP connection along with BGP message are called BGP connection
- BGP that spans two ASs is called an external BGP (eBGP)
- Session between routings in the same AS is canned an internal BGP (iBGP)

### Determining the Best Routes

- Routers often receive reachability information about dozens of different possible paths
- When router advertises a prefix across BGP connection, its includes BGP attributes
- A prefix along with its attributes is called a route
	- AS-PATH
	- NEXT-HOP
