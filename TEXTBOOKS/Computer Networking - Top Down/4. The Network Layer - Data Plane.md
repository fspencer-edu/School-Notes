- There is a piece of the network layer in each and every host and router in the network
- 2 parts of the network layer
	- Data plane
		- Per-router functions in the network layer that determine how a datagram arriving on one of the router's input links is forwarded to one of that router's output links
	- Control plane
		- The network wide logic that controls how a datagram is routed among routers along an end-to-end path from source host to the destination host
- Software defined networking (SDN) explicitly separates the data plane and control plane by implementing these control plane functions as a separate service

## Overview of Network Layer

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251219101556.png" alt="image" width="500">

- The primary data plane role of each router is to forward datagrams from its input links to its output links
- The primary role of the network control plane is to coordinate these local, per-router forwarding actions so that datagrams are ultimately transferred end-to-end, along paths of routers between source and destination hosts

### Forwarding and Routing: The Network Data and Control Planes

- Move packets from a sending host to a receiving host
	- Forwarding
		- Implemented in the data plane
		- A packet travelling to Host A to B
		- Packet may also be blocked from existing a router or duplicated and send over multiple outgoing links
	- Routing
		- Routing algorithms
		- Implemented in the control plane

- Forwarding refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface
	- Short timescales
	- Implemented in hardware
- Routing refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination
	- Longer timesvales
	- Implemented in software

- Forwarding table
	- A router forwards a packet by examining the value of one or more fields in the arriving packet's header
	- Uses these header values to index into its forwarding table
	- The stored values indicate the outgoing link

**Control Plane: The Traditional Approach**
- The routing algorithm determines the contents of the routers' forwarding tables
- The routing algorithm function in one router communicates with the routing algorithm function in other routers
- Exchanges messages containing routing information

**Control Plane: SDN Approach**
- A physically separate (from the routers), remote controller computes and distributes the forwarding tables for each router

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251219102606.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Linux OS code

### Network Service Models

- The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end delivery of packets between sending an receiving hosts

Services
1. Guaranteed delivery
2. Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay
3. In-order packet delivery
4. Guaranteed minimal bandwidth
5. Security

- The Internet's network layer provides a single service, known as best-effort service
- Packets are neither guaranteed to be received in the order, or delivered
- ATM network architecture provides for guaranteed in-order delay, bounded delay, and guaranteed minimal bandwidth
- Intserv architecture aims to provide end-end delay guarantees and congestion-free communication

- Forwarding and switching are used interchangeably
- Packet switch means a general packet-switching device that transfers a packet from input link interface to output link interface
- Some packet switches, called link-layer switches, base their forwarding decision value in the field of the link-layer frame
	- Switches are referred to as link layer devices
- Other packet switches, called routers, base their forwarding decision on header field values in the network-layer datagram
	- Routers are network-layer devices

## What's Inside a Router?


<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251219183237.png" alt="image" width="500">


4 Components of a Router
1) Input ports
	1) Physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router
	2) Performs link-layer functions needed to interoperate with the link layer at the other side of the incoming link
	3) Lookup function is also performed at the input port
2) Switching fabric
	1) Connects the router's input ports and output ports
	2) Contained within the router
3) Output ports
	1) Stores packets received from the switching fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer and physical-layer function
	2) Bidirectional, an output port will be paired with the input port for that link on the same line card
4) Routing processor
	1) Performs control plane functions
	2) Traditional routers
		1) Routing protocols
		2) Routing tables
		3) Computes the forwarding table
	3) SDN routers
		1) Communicates with the remote controller in order to receive forwarding table entries from remote controller

- Control plane functions are implemented in software and execute on the routing processor (CPU)

Processing
- Destination based forwarding
- Generalized forwarding

### Input Port Processing and Destination-Based Forwarding

- Forwarding table is either computed and updated by the routing processor or is received from a remote SDN controller
- Table is copied from the routing processor to the line cards over a separate bus (PCI)
- Forwarding decisions can be made locally, at each input port

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251219184233.png" alt="image" width="500">

- 32-bit IP addresses, a brute-force implementation oof the forwarding table is used to get the destination address

```c
Link Interface --- Destination Address Range

0 --- 11001000 00010111 00010000 00000000 through 11001000 00010111 00010111 1111111

1 --- 11001000 00010111 00011000 00000000 through 11001000 00010111 00011000 11111111

2 ---11001000 00010111 00011001 00000000 through 11001000 00010111 00011111 11111111

3 --- Otherwise
```

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251219184535.png" alt="image" width="500">

- The router matches a prefix of the packet destination address with the entries in the table
- When there are multiple matches, the router uses the longest prefix matching rule
- Embedded on-chip DRAM and faster SRAM (used as DRAM cache) is used
- Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) are also used for lookup
- Physical and link layer processing must occur
- Packet's version number
- Checksum and time-to-live field
- In a network address translator (NAT), an incoming packet whose transport-layer port number matches a given value will have its port number rewritten before forwarding

### Switching

- Switching via memory
	- Under direct control of the CPU
	- Two packets cannot be forwarded at the same time
- Switching via a bus
	- Input port transfers a packet directly to the output port over a shared bus
	- Without intervention by the router processor
	- Switching speed of the router is limited to the bus speed
- Switching via an interconnection network
	- Each vertical bus intersects each horizontal bus at a crosspoint
	- A crossbar switch is non-blocking
		- A packet being forwarded to an output port will not be blocked from reaching that output port as long as no other packet is currently being forwarded to that output port
		- Cisco, CRS uses a three-stage non-blocking switching strategy

### Output Port Processing

- Takes packets that have been stored in the output port's memory and transmits them over the output link
- Selecting and de-queuing packets for transmission

### Where Does Queuing Occur?

- Packet queues may form at both the input and output ports
- Location and extent will depend on
	- Traffic load
	- Relative speed of the switching fabric
	- Line speed
- When queues grow large, the router's memory can eventually be exhausted and packet loss will occur when no memory is available

![[Pasted image 20251220110901.png]]


**Input Queueing**
- Multiple packets cam be transferred in parallel, as long as their output ports are diferent
- If two packets at the front have the same destination, then one packet is blocked


![[Pasted image 20251220111223.png]]

- Head-of-the-line (HOL) blocking in an input queued switch
	- A queued packet in an input queue must wait for transfer through the fabric because it is blocked by another packet at the head of the line
- The middle destined packet must wait, since it is behind the packets which is blocked


**Output Queueing**
- Packet queues can form at the output ports even when the switching fabric is N times faster than the port line speeds
- When there is not enough memory to buffer an incoming packet, a decision must be made to either drop the arriving packet (drop-tail) or remove one or more already-queued packets
- Proactive packet-dropping and marking policies are known as active queue management (AQM) algorithms
	- Random Early Detection (RED)


![[Pasted image 20251220111742.png]]

- Packet scheduler at the output port must choose one packet for transmission

### Packet Scheduling

- First-come-first server (FSFS), also known as FIFO
- Priority basis
- Round-robin

**First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**

![[Pasted image 20251220112209.png]]

- Packet arrivals are indicated by numbered arrows above the upper timeline, with the number indicating the order in which the packet arrived

![[Pasted image 20251220112340.png]]

**Priority Queuing**
- Packets arriving at the output link are classified into priority classes upon arrival at the queue
- Network operator may configure a queue so that packets carrying network management information receive priority user traffic
- Real-time voice-over-IP packets might receive priority over non-real traffic such as SMTP or IMAP email packets

![[Pasted image 20251220112512.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251220112531.png]]

- Under a non-preemptive priority queueing discipline, the transmission of a packet is not interrupted once it has begun

**Round Robin and Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)**
- Alternates service among the classes
- Work-conserving queuing discipline will never allow the link to remain ideal when there are packets queued
- A generalized form of round robin queuing is weighted fair queuing (WFQ) discipline
- WFQ scheduler serve classes in a circular manner

## The Internet Protocol (IP): IPv4, Addressing, IPv6, and More

- 2 versions of IP
	- IPv4
	- IPv6

![[Pasted image 20251220113012.png]]

### IPv4 Datagram Format

- Network layer packet is referred to as a datagram

IPv4 Key Fields
- Version number
- Header length
- Type of service (TOS)
- Datagram length
- Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset
- Time-to-live (TTL)
- Protocol
- Header checksum
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Options
- Data (payload)

### IPv4 Datagram Fragmentation

- Not all link-layer protocols can carry network-layer packets of the same size
	- Ethernet frames can carry up to 1500 bytes of data
	- Wide-area links can carry no more than 576 bytes
- The max amount of data is called the maximum transmission unit (MTU)
- Each of the smaller datagrams is referred to as a fragment
- The job of the datagram reassembly is in the end system rather than in network routers
- IPv4 puts identification, flag, and fragment offset fields in the IP datagram header
- In order for the destination host to be sure is has received the last fragment, the flag is set to 0


![[Pasted image 20251220114121.png]]


### IPv4 Addressing

- A host typically has only a single link into the network
- The boundary between the host and the physical link is called an interface
- A router has multiple interfaces, one for each of its links
- IP requires each host and router interface to have its own IP addresses
- An IP address is associated with an interface, rather than with the host or router containing that interface
- Each IP address is 32 bits long
- Written in dotted-decimal notation
- Each interface on every host and router in the global internet must have an IP addresses that is unique
- This network interconnecting 3 host interfaces and one router interface forms a subset or IP network

![[Pasted image 20251220114623.png]]

- A subnet mask, indicates that the leftmost 24 bits of the 32-bits quantity define the subnet address
- To determine the subnets, detach each interface from its host or router, creating islands of isolated networks, with interfaces terminating the end points of the isolated networks
- Each isolated network is called a subnet
- Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR)
- CIDR generalizes the notion of subnet addressing
- Before CIDR was adopted, the network portions of an IP address were constrained to be 8, 16, or 24 bits in length, an addressing scheme known as classful addressing
- The ability to use a single prefix to advertise multiple networks is often referred to as address aggregation
	- Also route aggregation or route summarization

![[Pasted image 20251220142959.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251220143009.png]]

**Obtaining a Block of Addresses**
- To obtain a block of IP addresses a network administrator might first contact its ISP, which would provide addresses from a larger block of addresses
- Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

**Obtaining a Host Address: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**
- A system administrator will typically manually configure the IP addresses into the router
- Host addresses can be configured manually
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows a host to obtain an IP address automatically
- DHCP's ability to automate the network-related aspects of connecting a host into a network, it is often referred to as a plug-and-play or zeroconf protocol
- DHCP is a client-server protocol
	- A client is typically a newly arriving host wanting to obtain network configuration informations, including an IP address for itself
	- Each subnet will have a DHCP server
	- If no server is present, a DHCP relay agent that knowns the address of a DHCP server is needed

![[Pasted image 20251220143725.png]]

4 Steps of DHCP Protocol
1) DHCP server discovery
	1) DHCP discover message
		1) Client sends within a UDP packet to port 67
2) DHCP server offers
	1) DHCP offer message
	2) IP address lease time
		1) Amount of time for which the IP address will be valid
3) DHCP request
	1) DCHP request message
4) DHCP ACK
	1) DHCP ACK message

### Networking Address Translation (NAT)

- Network address translation (NAT)
- NAT-enabled router, has an interface that is part of the home network
- IP address space that is reserved in for a private network or a realm with private addresses

![[Pasted image 20251220151922.png]]

- NAT-enabled router behave to the outside world as a single device with a single IP address
- All traffic leaving the home router for the larger Internet has a source IP address
- NAT-enabled router is hiding the details of the home network fro the outside world
- NAT translation table at the NAT router, and to include port numbers as well as IP addresses in the table entries
- NAT traversal tools and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
	- Protocol that allows a host to discover and configure a nearby NAT
- NAT violates this principle that hosts should be talking directly with each other, without interfering nodes modifying IP addresses
- NAT and other middleboxes have become an important component in the internet
	- Load balancing of traffic flows
	- Traffic fire walling

#### Inspecting Datagrams: Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems

- Two popular defense mechanisms to malicious packet attacks are firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs)
- Firewalls inspect the datagrams and segment header fields
- A firewall may be configured to block all ICMP echo request packets
- IDS situated at the network boundary, performs "deep packet inspection"
	- Payloads in the datagram

### IPv6

**IPv6 Datagram Format**
- Expanded addressing capabilities
- A streamlined 40-byte header
- Flow labeling

![[Pasted image 20251220152627.png]]

**IPv6 Fields**
- Version
- Traffic class
- Flow label
- Next header
- Hop limit
- Source and destination addresses
- Data

**Fields in IPv4, not in IPv6**
- Fragmentation/reassembly
- Header checksum
- Options

**Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6**
- The last major technology transition (from NCP to TCP) occurred almost 35 years ago
	- Flag day
- IPv4-to-IPv6 involves tunneling
- NIST reports that more than one third of US government second-level domains are IPv6 enabled

![[Pasted image 20251220153030.png]]


## Generalized Forwarding and SDN

- NAT boxes rewrite header IP addresses and port numbers
- Firewalls block traffic based on header-field values or redirect packets for additional processing
	- Deep packet inspection (DPI)
- Load balancers forward packets requesting a given service to one of a set of servers that provide that service
-
