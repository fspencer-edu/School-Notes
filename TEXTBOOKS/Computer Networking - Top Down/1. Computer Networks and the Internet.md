## What Is the Internet?

- Internet is the infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications

### A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

- Servers store and transmit informations
	- Web pages
	- Email
- Were once PCs, Linux workstations
- Internet is now on
	- Laptops
	- Smartphones
	- Tablets
	- TVs
	- Console
	- Security systems
	- Appliances
	- Cars
- These are called hosts or end systems

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211160016.png" alt="image" width="500">

- End systems are connected by a network of communication links and packet switches
- Communication links are made up of different physical media
	- Coaxial cable
	- Copper wire
	- Optical fibre
	- Radio spectrum
- Different links can transmit data at different rate (transmission rate in bits/second)
- The sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment
	- Packets are send through the network to the destination
	- Reassembled to the original data
- Packet switch takes a packet forwards the packet from incoming to outgoing communication links

2 Types of Packet Switches
1) Routers
2) Link layer switches

- Both types forward packets to their destination
- Routers
	- Used in the network once
- Link layers
	- Used in access networks
- Sequence of links that is traversed by a packet is the route or path
- Cisco predicts annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte ($10^{21}$ bytes) by 2016
- End systems access the internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
	- Residential ISPs
		- Local cable
		- Telephone companies
	- Corporate ISPs
	- University ISPs
	- Public ISPs
		- WiFi
	- Cellular data ISPs
- Each ISP is a network of communication links and packet switches

- ISPs provides different types of networks
	- Residential broadband
		- Cable modem or DSL
		- High-speed LAN
		- Mobile wireless access
	- Content providers
		- Web and video servers

- Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs
- Upper-tier has a high-speed router with high-speed fibre-optic links
- Each ISP network is managed independently

Level 3 (Top-Tier) Communications
- AT&T
- Sprint
- NTT

- Internet runs protocols that control the sending and receiving of information
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are the two most important protocols in the internet
- IP
	- Specified the format of the packets
- TCP/IP
	- Collective internet principal protocols

- Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)
	- RFCs start as requests to resolve network and protocol design
	- Protocols such as
		- TCP
		- IP
		- HTTP
		- SMTP

### A Services Description

- Internet is also the infrastructure that provides services to application
	- Email
	- Web
	- Internet messaging
	- Mapping
	- Music streaming
	- Video streaming
	- Social networks
	- Multi-person games

- These application are distributed applications
- Internet application run on end systems
	- Not in the packet switched in network core

- End systems attached to the internet provide a socket interface that specifies how to deliver data from a source to a destination program
	- Set of rules

### What Is a Protocol?

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211161902.png" alt="image" width="500">


- A network takes two or more communicating entities running the same protocol
- Hardware protocols in connected computers control the flow of bits between two network interface cards
- Congestion control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted
- Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

**URL Request**
1) Computer will send a connection request to web server and wait for reply
2) Web server will receive request, and return a reply (OK)
3) Computer will send name of web page to fetch from web server in GET message
4) Web server return the web page

- A protocol defined the format and the order of messages exchanges between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event


## The Network Edge


<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211162904.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Computers and other devices are referred to as end systems

**End systems**
- Computers
- Servers
- Mobile devices

- End systems are also referred to as hosts since they run application programs

#### INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)

- 2015 there are 5 B things connected to the internet
	- Wearable technology
- IoT adds huge security and privacy risks

- Hosts are further divided into
	- Clients
	- Servers
- Clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs
- Servers are more powerful machined and distribute web pages, email, streaming
- More servers reside in data centres

 
### Access Networks

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211162925.png" alt="image" width="500">

- The access network is the physical connection from end system to the first router ("edge router")

- 2 most prevalent types of broadband residential access
	- Digital subscriber line (DSL)
	- Cable

**DSL**

- DSL internet access if from same local telephone company that provides phone access
	- Therefore also ISP
	- Each customer's DSL model uses the existing phone line (twisted pair copper wire) to exchange data with DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in telco's local central office (CO)
	- DSL takes digital data and translates to high-frequency tones for transmission
	- Analog signals from houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM

- Residential phone lines carry both data and traditional telephone signals encoded in different frequencies
	- High-speed downstream channel: 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
	- Medium-speed upstream channel: 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
	- Two-way telephone channel: 0 to 4 kHz band

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211163443.png" alt="image" width="500">


- Splitter separates the data and phone signals
- In the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals
- DSL standard transmission rates
	- ITU 1999
		- 12 Mbps downstream
		- 1.8 Mbps upstream
	- ITU 2006
		- 55 Mbps downstream
		- 15 Mbps upstream

- Access is asymmetric since downstream and upstream rates differ
- Rates are tiered service are different costs
- The  max rate is limited by the distance between the home and CO, the gauge of the twisted-pair line, and the degree of electrical interference
- DSL used for short distances

**Cable Internet Access**
- Uses the cable TV existing cable infrastructure
- Fibre optics connect the cable head end to the neighbourhood level junctions, from coaxial cables
- Referred ti as a hybrid fibre coax (HFC system

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211164042.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Internet access requires special models
	- Cable models
	- External device and connects to the home PC through Ethernet port
- Cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DLS's DSLAM
	- Turning analog into digital format
- Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels
	- Downstream
	- Upstream
- Downstream allocated a higher transmission rate
- DOCSIS 2.0 standard
	- 42.8 Mbps downstream
	- 30.7 Mbps upstream

- Internet access is a shared broadcast medium
- Every packet send by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet send travels upstream to the head end
- Several users can affect the transmission rate, or low use can increase the rate
- Distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions

- DSL and cable networks represent more than 85% of residential broadband access in US

**New Network Technology**
- Fibre to the Home (FTTH) provides even higher speeds
- Provides an optical fibre path from the CO directly to the home
	- Direct fibre to each home
	- Or fibre leaving the CO is shared by many homes
- Optical distribution network architectures
	- Active optical networks (AON)
		- Switched ethernet
	- Passive optical networks (PON)

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211164828.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Each optical network terminator (ONT) is connected by dedicated optical fibre to a neighbourhood splitter, and connects to an optical line terminator (OLT) in CO
	- Less than 100 homes
- OLT provides conversion from optical to electrical signals
- Users connect a home router to ONT for internet access
- PON has all packets send from OLT to the splitter replicated at the splitter
- FTTH can potentially provide internet at rates in the gb/s
	- Cost more
	- Downstream ~20 Mbps

**Other Network Technologies**
- Satellite link
	- Used to connect a residence to internet of more than 1 Mbps
	- StarBand
	- HughesNet
- Dial-up access
	- Based on DSL model
	- Connects home model over a phone line to a modem in the ISP
	- 56 kbps

#### Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi

- A local area network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router
- Ethernet is the more used
	- Users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch
	- Ethernet switch is then connect into the larger internet
	- Users have 100 Mbps/1 Gbps
	- Servers have 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211165725.png" alt="image" width="500">

- In wireless LAN setting, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point that is connected into the enterprise's network, which is connected to the wired internet
- A wireless LAN user must be within a few tens of meters to access point
- Wireless LAN is based on IEEE 802.11, also known as WiFi
	- Provides up to more than 100 Mbps
- Many homes combine broadband residential access with inexpensive wireless LAN for home networks

**Home Network**
- Roaming laptop
- Wired PC
- Base station (wireless access point)
	- Communicates with wireless PC
- Cable modem
	- Provides broadband access
- Router
	- Interconnects the base station and PC with cable modem

- This network allows users to have broadband access to the internet anywhere in the house

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211170238.png" alt="image" width="500">


- Phone are being used in public
- Devices employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by a cellular network provider
- A user needs to be within a few tens of kilometers of the base station

**3G**
- Third-generation wireless (3G) provides packet-switched wide-area wireless internet access at speeds in excess of 1 Mbps

**4G**
- Fourth-generation of wide area wireless networks provide higher speeds

**LTE**
- Long term evolution

**Costs**
- Physical link is relatively minor compared with other networking costs
- Labour costs of installation is much higher than the material costs
- Builders use twisted pair, optical fibre, and coaxial cable in every room in a building

#### Twisted-Pair Copper Wire

- The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium
- Telephone networks
- More than 99% of the wired connections from telephone handset to local telephone switch
- Two insulated copper wires, about 1 mm thick
- Spiral pattern
- Twisted to reduce electrical interference from nearby pairs
- Number of pairs are bundles in a protective shield
- Pair constitutes a single communication link
- Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is used for computer networks in buildings (LANs)
- Data rates for LANs using twisted pairs range from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps
- Rates depend on thickness and distance
- Modern twister-pair technology
	- 6a has data rates of 10 Gbps for distances up to a 100 m
- Twisted pair is the dominant solution for high-speed LAN networking
- Also used in residential internet access
	- Dial up
	- DSL


#### Coaxial Cable

- Consists of two copper conductors
	- Concentric rather than parallel
- Achieve high data rates

- Satellite receives transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a repeater, and transmits the signal on another frequency

**2 Types**
1) Geostationary satellites
2) Low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites

## The Network Core


<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211193331.png" alt="image" width="500">

### Packet Switching

- End systems exchange messages with each other
- Messages contain anything the application wants
- Message perform functions or contain data
- The source breaks messages into small chucks known as packets
- Between source and destination, packets are sent through packet switches
	- Routers
	- Link-layer switches
- Packets are transmitted over link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate
- A packet of $L$ bits over a link with transmission rate $R$ bits/sec, has a transmit time of $L/R$ seconds

#### Store-and-Forward Transmission

- Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs
- Packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link
- A router will have many incident links
	- Its job is to attach incoming packets to the corresponding link


<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211193902.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Source has 3 packets to a destination
	- Each consisting of $L$ bits
- The source transmitted packet 1, which has arrived at the router
- Router puts in buffer
- Then transmits packets when all bits have arrived
- Source begins to transmit at time $0$
- At $L/R$ for the router has received the entire packet
- Therefore, at $2L/R$, the router has transmitted the entire packet

For 3 Packets
- $2L/R$ for first packet to destination, and 2nd packet to router
- $3L/R$, 1st and 2nd at destination, 3rd at router
- Therefore, $4L/R$ for all three packets

General
- $N$ links each of rate $R$
- $N-1$ routers between source and destination

$d_{end-to-end}=NLR$

#### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

- Each packet switch has multiple links
- For each link, the packet switch has an output buffer/queue
	- Stores packet in router
- In addition to store-and-forward delays, packets suffer output buffer queuing delays
- Delays are variable and depend on level of congestion in the network
- Arriving packet may encounter a full buffer
	- Resulting in packet loss

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211194843.png" alt="image" width="500">

- A and B are sending packets to E
- A and B send along 100 Mbps Ethernet links to first router
- Router directs packets to 15 Mpbs links
- If the arrival rate of packets to router exceeds 15 Mpbs, congestion will occurs at router
- A and B each send a burst of 5 packets, the most stay at the queue

#### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols

**Packet Switching**

- Packet forwarding is done through different types of computer networks
- Every end system has an IP address
- Source includes the destination's IP address in packet's header
- Router examines packet destination and forwards to adjacent router
- Each router has a forwarding table that maps designation addresses to router's outbound links
- Internet has special routing protocols used to automatically set the forwarding tables
- Determine shortest path from each router to each destination
- Use shortest path results to configure the tables in the routers


### Circuit Switching

**2 Approaches to Moving Data Through Links and Switches**
1) Circuit switching
2) Packet switching

- Packet switching was covered in the previous section

**Circuit Switching**

- The resource needed along a path to provide for communication are reserved for the duration of the communication session
- In packet switching
	- Resources are not reserved
	- A session's messages use the resources on demand, therefore they have to wait

- Packet switching - No reservations
- Circuit switching - reservation

- Telephone networks use circuit switched networks
- When the network established the circuit, its also reserves a constant transmission rate for the duration of the connection
- Guaranteed constant rate

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211201120.png" alt="image" width="500">

- 4 circuits switches are interconnected by four links
- If each link between adjacent switches has a transmission rate of 1 Mbps, then each end-to-end circuit-switch connection get 250 kpbs of dedicated transmission rate

- In a packet-switched network, such as the internet
- Packet is send into the network without reserving any link resources
- If congested, then packet will wait in buffer

#### Multi-plexing in Circuit-Switched Networks

- A circuit is a link implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM)

**FDM**
- Frequency spectrum of a link is divided among the connections established across the link
- Link dedicates a frequency band to each connection
	- Phone: 4 kHz
- The width of the band is called the bandwidth
- FM radio stations also use FDM to share the frequency spectrums between 88 MHz and 108 MHz

**TDM**
- Time is divided into frames of fixed duration
- Each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots
- When a connection is established, it dedicates one time slot in every frame

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211201816.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Proponents of packet-switching have agued that circuit switching is wasteful because dedicated circuits are idle during silent periods
- Also point out that establishing end-to-end circuits and reserving transmission capacity is complicated and requires complex signalling to coordinate the operation

- Host A to B sends a file 640,000 bits over a circuit-switched network
- All links in use TDM with 24 slots with a bit rate of 1.536 Mbps
- 500 msec to establish end-to-end circuit before A can begin to transmit the file

_How long does it take to send the file?_

$L/R$ = $T_{transmission}$

$T_{setup} = 500$ ms

Circuit rate = $1.536/24 = 64$ kpbs

$T_{transmission} = 640000/64000 = 10$ seconds

Total time = $T_{setup} + T_{transmission} = 0.5 + 10 = 10.5$ seconds

Therefore, the total time to send the file is 10.5 seconds


#### Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching

**Packet Switching**
- Offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit
- Simpler, more efficient, less costly to complement
- Provides the same performance, and for more than 3x the number of users
- Allocated link use on demand

**Circuit Switching**
- More predictable and less end-to-end delays
- Active users can continuously send its packets
- Pre-allocates the use of the transmission link

### A Network of Networks

- ISPs are interconnected, creating a network of networks

**Network Structure 1**
- Interconnects all the the access ISPs with a single global transmit ISP
- Access ISP is the customer
- Global ISP is the provider

**Network Structure 2**
- Multiple global transit ISPs
- Choose among competing global ISPs
- 2-tier hierarchy
- Regional ISP for the access ISPs to connect
- Regional ISPs connect to the tier-1 ISP (global)
	- AT&T
	- Sprint
	- NTT

**Network Structure 3**
- Multi-tier hierarchy
- Points of presence (PoPs)
- Multi-homing
- Peering
- Internet exchange points (IXPs)
- PoP is a group of one or more routers in the provider's network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP
- To reduce costs, a pair of nearby ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy can peer
	- Directly connect their networks together so that all the traffic between them passes over the direct connection rather than through upstream intermediaries
- Internet Exchange Point (IXP)
	- A meeting point where multiple ISPs can peer together
	- Stand alone building with its own switches

**Network Structure 4**
- Ecosystem
	- ISPs
	- PoPs
	- Multi-homing
	- Peering
	- IXPs

**Network Structure 5**
- Today's structure
- Built on top of structure 4, adds content-provider networks
	- Google
- Major content providers have created their own networks and connect directly into lower-tier ISPs

## Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

### Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks

- Packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path
	- Nodal processing delay
	- Queuing delay
	- Transmission delay
	- Propagation delay
- All these delays accumulate to give total nodal delay

**Types of Delays**
- Packet can be transmitted on a link only if there is no other packets currently being transmitted and there are not other packets preceding it in the queue

![[Pasted image 20251212110645.png]]


**Processing Delay**
- The time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet
- Time needed to check for bit-level errors
- Microseconds or less
- Router directs the packets to the queue that precedes the link to router B

**Queuing Delay**
- Waits to be transmitted onto the link
- Order or microseconds to milliseconds

**Transmission Delay ($L/R$)**
- Packets can be transmitted only after all the packets have arrived
- Transmission delay is the amount of time required to push all the packet's bit into the link
- Order or microseconds to milliseconds
- Amount of time required for the router to push out the packet
- Does not use distance

**Propagation Delay ($d/s$)**
- Propagates to router B
- Time to propagate from the beginning of the link to B
- Speed depends on physical medium and range
- Distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed
- Time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next
- Does no use packet length or transmission rate

$d_{nodal}=d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{prop}$

### Queuing Delay and Packet Loss


- Queuing delay can vary from packet to packet
- Therefore uses statistical measures
	- Averaging queuing delay
	- Variance of queuing delay
	- Probability that the queuing delay exceed some specific value

$L_a$ = average rate of bits
$R$ = transmission rate

$L_a/R$ = traffic intensity

- If > 1
	- Then the average rate at which bits arrive exceed the rate of transmission from queue
- Therefore, design the system so that the traffic intensity is no greater than 1

- If <= 1
	- Packets arrive periodically
	- First packet as no delay
	- Second packet has queuing delay of $L/S$
	- nth packet has queuing delay of $(n-1)L/R$

- The arrival process to a queue is random
- If traffic intensity is close to zero, then packets rarely have a queuing delay
- If traffic intensity approaches 1, then queue length get exponentially larger

![[Pasted image 20251212112155.png]]

**Packet Loss**
- Queue capacity is finite
- Packet delays do not approach infinity
- If a packet arrives at a full queue, with no storage, a router will drop that packet
- Packet loss will be transmitted but never arriving at the destination
- Node performance is measured in terms of probability of packet loss

### End-to-End Delay

- Total delay from source to destination
- N-1 routers between the source and destination

$d_{end-end} = N(d_{proc}+d_{trans}+d_{prop})$

**Traceroute**
- Traceroute program is used to run internet host
- Source can reconstruct the route taken by packets flowing from source to destination
- There are 9 routers between the source and destination
- First of the 3 trials, the round-trip delay was 1.03 msec
- Subsequent trials were 0.48 and 0.48 msec

**End System, Application, and Other Delays**
- End systems want to transmit a packet into a shared medium (WiFi or cable) may purposefully delay transmission in its protocol
- Media packetization delay
	- Present in Voice-over-IP (VoIP)

### Throughput and Computer Networks

- Instantaneous throughput is used in many applications and the internet

![[Pasted image 20251212113333.png]]

- Therefore the throughput is min{$R_c, R_s$}
- The transmission rate of the bottleneck link
- (b) is a network with N links between server and client
- Throughput for a file is min{$R1, R2, ..., Rn$}
- Throughput depends on the transmission rate of the links

![[Pasted image 20251212113552.png]]

- Throughput depends not only on the transmission rates of the links along the path, but also the intervening traffic

## Protocol Layers and Their Service Models

### Layered Architecture

- Layered architecture allows for a well-defined, and specific parts of a large and complex system
	- Modularity
- Ability to change the implementation of a service without affecting other components

**Protocol Layering**
- Each protocol belongs to one of the layers
- Service model of a layer
	- Performs certain actions within that layer
	- Uses the services of the layer directly below it
- Implemented in software, hardware, of both
- Application layer protocols
	- HTTP
	- SMPT
- One drawback of layering is that on layer may duplicate lower-layer functionality
- Protocols stacks provide error recovery on both a per-link basis and end-to-end basis
- Functionality at one layer may violate the another layer
- Layers are called the protocol stack
- Internet consists of 5 layers

![[Pasted image 20251212114316.png]]


**Application Layer**
- Network applications and their application-layer protocol reside
- HTTP
- SMPT
- FTP
- Domain name system (DNS)
- Packet information at this layer is called a message

**Transport Layer**
- Transport messages between application endpoints
- TCP
	- Connect-oriented service
	- Guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to destination
	- Breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides congestion-control
- UDP
	- Connectionless service to its application
	- No flow control
	- No congestion control
- Transport layer packet is referred as a segment

**Network Layer**
- Internet's network layer move packets known as datagrams
- Internet transport-layer protocol (TCP or UDP) in source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer
- Network layer then provides the service delivering the segment to the transport layer in destination host
- IP protocol
	- Defines the fields in the datagram
	- End systems and routers act on these fields
- Only one IP protocol
- Contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destinations

**Link Layer**
- Network layer relies on link layer
- At each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node
- Link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer
- Specific link-layer protocols
	- Reliable delivery is based on service of TCP
	- Ethernet
	- WiFi
	- Cable access network's DOCSIS protocol
- Refer to link-layer packets as frames

**Physical Layer**
- Move entire frame from one network element to an adjacent network element
- Move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next
- Dependent on medium of link

**The OSI Model**
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) proposed that computer networks be organized around 7 layers
- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
- Late 1970s
- Used in network education
- Adds
	- Presentation layer
	- Session layer

**Presentation Layer**
- Provide service that allow communicating applications to interpret the meaning of data exchange
- Data compression
- Data encryption
- Data description

**Session Layer**
- Provides delimiting and synchronization of data exchange
- Build a checkpointing and recovery scheme

### Encapsulation

- Routers and link-layer switches are both packet switches
- Do not implement all the layers in the protocol stack
- Implement only the bottom layers
- Link layer switches implement layer 1 and 2
- Routers implement layers 1 through 3
- Hosts implement all 5
- An application-layer message is passed to the transport layer
- Application layer and transport layer header constitute the transport layer segment
	- This encapsulates the application-layer message
- Transport layer then passes the segment to network, which adds network-layer header information such as source and destination
	- Creating a network-layer datagram
	- Then become link-layer frame
- Packets have 2 types of fields
	- Header fields
	- Payload fields

## Networks Under Attack

**Malware**
- Malicious programs that can enter and infect devices
- Malware is self-replicating
- Viruses are malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the user's device
- Worms are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction

**Attack on Servers and Network Infrastructure**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

DoS attacks
1) Vulnerability attack
2) Bandwidth flooding
3) Connection flooding

- Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source blast traffic at the target
- Leverages botnets
- Harder to detect and defend against DoS

**Sniff Packets**
- Passive receiver that records a copy of every packet is called a packet sniffer
- Do not inject packets into the channel

**Masquerade**
- Inject packets into the internet with false source address is known as IP spoofing
- End-point authentication


## History of Computer Networking and the Internet

### The Development of Packet Switching (1961-1972)

- Networking and internet trace back to the early 1960s
- Telephone network uses circuit switching to transmit information
- The first packet-switched computer network and a direct ancestor to today's internet was the ARPAnet (Advanced Research Project Agency)
- First host-to-host protocol between ARPAnet end systems, known as the network control protocol (NCP) in 1972

### Proprietary Networks and Inter-networking (1972-1980)

- ARPAnet was a single, closed network
- ALOHANet
- DARPA's packet satellite
- Packet radio networks
- Early versions of TCP combined reliable in-sequence delivery of data via end-system retransmission with forwarding functions

### The Proliferation of Networks (1908-1990)

- 
### The Internet Explosion (1990s)
### The New Millennium
