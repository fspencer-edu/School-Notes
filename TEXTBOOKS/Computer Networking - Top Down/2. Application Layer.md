## Principles of Network Applications

### Network Application Architectures

- Network application development is writing programs that run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network

- From application development, the network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications
- Application architecture is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured

- 2 Methods
	- Client-server
	- Peer-to-peer architecture

- Client-server architecture
	- Server is an always on host that services requests from the clients
	- Web server
	- Clients do no directly communicate with each other
	- Server has a fixed address (IP)
	- A client can always contact server
	- FTP
	- Telnet
	- Email
	- Single-server host is incapable of keeping up will all requests

- Data centres house large number of hosts to hand requests

- P2P architecture
	- Minimal or no reliance on dedicated servers in data centres
	- Applications uses direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers
	- Most of today's popular and traffic-intensive applications
	- File sharing
	- Self-scalability
		- Each peer also adds service capacity to the system by distributing files to other peers
	- Cost effective
	- Decentralized structure

### Processing Communicating

- A process is a program that is running within an end system
- Communicate with each other with interprocess communication
- Processes communicate with exchanging messages

**Client and Server Processes**
- A process can be both a client and server
- Process that initiates the communication is labeled the client
- The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the server

**Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network**
- The network through a software interface is called a socket
- Application Programming Interface (API) is the socket interface between the application layer and transport layer
- Application developer has control of everything on the application layer side, but little control of transport-layer
	- Choice of transport protocol
	- Ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and max segment sizes

**Addressing Processes**
- 2 pieces of information
	- Address of host
	- Identifier that specifies the receiving process in destination host

- Host is identified by its IP address
	- 32-bit number that uniquely identifies host
- A destination port number is used to identify receiving process
- Web server is identified by port number 89
- Mail server (SMTP) uses port 25


### Transport Services Available to Applications

- Transport layer protocol is responsible for getting messages to the socket of the receiving process

**Reliable Data Transfer**
- A packet can overflow a buffer in a router
- Can be discarded by a host or router for corrupted bits
- Process-to-process reliable data transfer, passes data into the socket with complete confidence that data will arrive without errors
- Loss-tolerant applications, such as multimedia has some amount of data loss

**Throughput**

- Other sessions share the bandwidth along the network path, the available throughput can fluctuate with time
- If the transport protocol cannot provide throughput, application needs to encode at a lower rate or give up half of data
- Applications have requirements that are bandwidth-sensitive
- Elastic applications can make use of as much, or as little, throughput available

**Timing**
- A transport-layer protocol can also provide timing guarantees
- Real-time application
- Telephone
- Virtual environments
- Multiplayer games

**Security**
- A transport protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process
- Receiving host decrypts data
- Also provide confidentiality, including data integrity and end-point authentication

### Transport Services Provided by the Internet

**TCP Services**
- The TCP service model includes a connection-oriented service and a reliable data transfer service
