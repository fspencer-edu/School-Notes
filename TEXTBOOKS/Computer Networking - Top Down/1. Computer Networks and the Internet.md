## What Is the Internet?

- Internet is the infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications

### A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

- Servers store and transmit informations
	- Web pages
	- Email
- Were once PCs, Linux workstations
- Internet is now on
	- Laptops
	- Smartphones
	- Tablets
	- TVs
	- Console
	- Security systems
	- Appliances
	- Cars
- These are called hosts or end systems

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211160016.png" alt="image" width="500">

- End systems are connected by a network of communication links and packet switches
- Communication links are made up of different physical media
	- Coaxial cable
	- Copper wire
	- Optical fibre
	- Radio spectrum
- Different links can transmit data at different rate (transmission rate in bits/second)
- The sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment
	- Packets are send through the network to the destination
	- Reassembled to the original data
- Packet switch takes a packet forwards the packet from incoming to outgoing communication links

2 Types of Packet Switches
1) Routers
2) Link layer switches

- Both types forward packets to their destination
- Routers
	- Used in the network once
- Link layers
	- Used in access networks
- Sequence of links that is traversed by a packet is the route or path
- Cisco predicts annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte ($10^{21}$ bytes) by 2016
- End systems access the internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
	- Residential ISPs
		- Local cable
		- Telephone companies
	- Corporate ISPs
	- University ISPs
	- Public ISPs
		- WiFi
	- Cellular data ISPs
- Each ISP is a network of communication links and packet switches

- ISPs provides different types of networks
	- Residential broadband
		- Cable modem or DSL
		- High-speed LAN
		- Mobile wireless access
	- Content providers
		- Web and video servers

- Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs
- Upper-tier has a high-speed router with high-speed fibre-optic links
- Each ISP network is managed independently

Level 3 (Top-Tier) Communications
- AT&T
- Sprint
- NTT

- Internet runs protocols that control the sending and receiving of information
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are the two most important protocols in the internet
- IP
	- Specified the format of the packets
- TCP/IP
	- Collective internet principal protocols

- Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)
	- RFCs start as requests to resolve network and protocol design
	- Protocols such as
		- TCP
		- IP
		- HTTP
		- SMTP

### A Services Description

- Internet is also the infrastructure that provides services to application
	- Email
	- Web
	- Internet messaging
	- Mapping
	- Music streaming
	- Video streaming
	- Social networks
	- Multi-person games

- These application are distributed applications
- Internet application run on end systems
	- Not in the packet switched in network core

- End systems attached to the internet provide a socket interface that specifies how to deliver data from a source to a destination program
	- Set of rules

### What Is a Protocol?

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211161902.png" alt="image" width="500">


- A network takes two or more communicating entities running the same protocol
- Hardware protocols in connected computers control the flow of bits between two network interface cards
- Congestion control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted
- Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

**URL Request**
1) Computer will send a connection request to web server and wait for reply
2) Web server will receive request, and return a reply (OK)
3) Computer will send name of web page to fetch from web server in GET message
4) Web server return the web page

- A protocol defined the format and the order of messages exchanges between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event


## The Network Edge


<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211162904.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Computers and other devices are referred to as end systems

**End systems**
- Computers
- Servers
- Mobile devices

- End systems are also referred to as hosts since they run application programs

#### INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)

- 2015 there are 5 B things connected to the internet
	- Wearable technology
- IoT adds huge security and privacy risks

- Hosts are further divided into
	- Clients
	- Servers
- Clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs
- Servers are more powerful machined and distribute web pages, email, streaming
- More servers reside in data centres

 
### Access Networks

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211162925.png" alt="image" width="500">

- The access network is the physical connection from end system to the first router ("edge router")

- 2 most prevalent types of broadband residential access
	- Digital subscriber line (DSL)
	- Cable

**DSL**

- DSL internet access if from same local telephone company that provides phone access
	- Therefore also ISP
	- Each customer's DSL model uses the existing phone line (twisted pair copper wire) to exchange data with DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in telco's local central office (CO)
	- DSL takes digital data and translates to high-frequency tones for transmission
	- Analog signals from houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM

- Residential phone lines carry both data and traditional telephone signals encoded in different frequencies
	- High-speed downstream channel: 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
	- Medium-speed upstream channel: 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
	- Two-way telephone channel: 0 to 4 kHz band

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211163443.png" alt="image" width="500">


- Splitter separates the data and phone signals
- In the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals
- DSL standard transmission rates
	- ITU 1999
		- 12 Mbps downstream
		- 1.8 Mbps upstream
	- ITU 2006
		- 55 Mbps downstream
		- 15 Mbps upstream

- Access is asymmetric since downstream and upstream rates differ
- Rates are tiered service are different costs
- The  max rate is limited by the distance between the home and CO, the gauge of the twisted-pair line, and the degree of electrical interference
- DSL used for short distances

**Cable Internet Access**
- Uses the cable TV existing cable infrastructure
- Fibre optics connect the cable head end to the neighbourhood level junctions, from coaxial cables
- Referred ti as a hybrid fibre coax (HFC system

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251211164042.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Internet access requires special models
	- Cable models
	- External device and connects to the home PC through Ethernet port
- Cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DLS's DSLAM
	- Turning analog into digital format
- Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels
	- Downstream
	- Upstream
- Downstream allocated a higher transmission rate
- DOCSIS 2.0 standard
	- 42.8 Mbps downstream
	- 30.7 Mbps upstream

- Internet access is a shared broadcast medium
- Every packet send by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet send travels upstream to the head end
- Several users can affect the transmission rate, or low use can increase the rate
- Distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions

- DSL and cable networks represent more than 85% of residential broadband access in US

**New Network Technology**
- Fibre to the Home (FTTH) provides even higher speeds
- Provides an optical fibre path from the CO directly to the home
	- Direct fibre to each home
	- Or fibre leaving the CO is shared by many homes
- Optical distribution network architectures
	- Active optical networks (AON)
		- Switched ethernet
	- Passive optical networks (PON)
