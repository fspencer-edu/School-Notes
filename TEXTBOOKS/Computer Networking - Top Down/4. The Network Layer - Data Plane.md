- There is a piece of the network layer in each and every host and router in the network
- 2 parts of the network layer
	- Data plane
		- Per-router functions in the network layer that determine how a datagram arriving on one of the router's input links is forwarded to one of that router's output links
	- Control plane
		- The network wide logic that controls how a datagram is routed among routers along an end-to-end path from source host to the destination host
- Software defined networking (SDN) explicitly separates the data plane and control plane by implementing these control plane functions as a separate service

## Overview of Network Layer

![[Pasted image 20251219101556.png]]

- The primary data plane role of each router is to forward datagrams from its input links to its output links
- The primary role of the network control plane is to coordinate these local, per-router forwarding actions so that datagrams are ultimately transferred end-to-end, along paths of routers between source and destination hosts

### Forwarding and Routing: The Network Data and Control Planes

- Move packets from a sending host to a receiving host
	- Forwarding
		- Implemented in the data plane
		- A packet travelling to Host A to B
		- Packet may also be blocked from existing a router or duplicated and send over multiple outgoing links
	- Routing
		- Routing algorithms
		- Implemented in the control plane

- Forwarding refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface
	- Short timescales
	- Implemented in hardware
- Routing refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination
	- Longer timesvales
	- Implemented in software

- Forwarding table
	- A router forwards a packet by examining the value of one or more fields in the arriving packet's header
	- Uses these header values to index into its forwarding table
	- The stored values indicate the outgoing link

**Control Plane: The Traditional Approach**
- The routing algorithm determines the contents of the routers' forwarding tables
- The routing algorithm function in one router communicates with the routing algorithm function in other routers
- Exchanges messages containing routing information

**Control Plane: SDN Approach**
- A physically separate (from the routers), remote controller computes and distributes the forwarding tables for each router

### Network Service Models

- The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end delivery of packets between sending an receiving hosts

Services
1. Guaranteed delivery
2. Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay
3. In-order packet delivery
4. Guaranteed minimal bandwidth
5. Security

- The Internet's network layer provides a single service, known as best-effort service
- Packets are neither guaranteed to be received in the order, or delivered
- ATM network architecture provides for guaranteed in-order delay, bounded delay, and guaranteed minimal bandwidth
- Intserv architecture aims to provide end-end delay guarantees and congestion-free communication

- Forwarding and switching are used interchangeably
- Packet switch means a general packet-switching device that transfers a packet from input link interface to output link interface
- Some packet switches, called link-layer switches, base their forwarding decision value in the field of the link-layer frame
	- Switches are referred to as link layer devices
- Other packet switches, called routers, base their forwarding decision on header field values in the network-layer datagram
	- Routers are network-layer devices

## What's Inside a Router?


![[Pasted image 20251219183237.png]]


4 Components of a Router
1) Input ports
	1) Physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router
	2) Performs link-layer functions needed to interoperate with the link layer at the other side of the incoming link
	3) Lookup function is also performed at the input port
2) Switching fabric
	1) Connects the router's input ports and output ports
	2) Contained within the router
3) Output ports
	1) Stores packets received from the switching fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer and physical-layer function
	2) Bidirectional, an output port will be paired with the input port for that link on the same line card
4) Routing processor
	1) Performs control plane functions
	2) Traditional routers
		1) Routing protocols
		2) Routing tables
		3) Computes the forwarding table
	3) SDN routers
		1) Communicates with the remote controller in order to receive forwarding table entries from remote controller

- Control plane functions are implemented in software and execute on the routing processor (CPU)

Processing
- Destination based forwarding
- Generalized forwarding

### Input Port Processing and Destination-Based Forwarding

- Forwarding table is either computed and updated by the routing processor or is received from a remote SDN controller
- Table is copied from the routing processor to the line cards over a separate bus (PCI)
- Forwarding decisions can be made locally, at each input port

- 32-bit IP addresses, a brute-force implementation oof the forwarding table is used to get the destination address

```c
Link Interface --- Destination Address Range

0 --- 11001000 00010111 00010000 00000000 through 11001000 00010111 00010111 1111111

1 --- 11001000 00010111 00011000 00000000 through 11001000 00010111 00011000 11111111

2 ---11001000 00010111 00011001 00000000 through 11001000 00010111 00011111 11111111

3 --- Otherwise
```

- The router matches a prefix of the packet destination address with the entries in the table
