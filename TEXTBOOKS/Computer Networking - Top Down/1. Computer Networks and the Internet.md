## What Is the Internet?

- Internet is the infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications

### A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

- Servers store and transmit informations
	- Web pages
	- Email
- Were once PCs, Linux workstations
- Internet is now on
	- Laptops
	- Smartphones
	- Tablets
	- TVs
	- Console
	- Security systems
	- Appliances
	- Cars
- These are called hosts or end systems

- End systems are connected by a network of communication links and packet switches
- Communication links are made up of different physical media
	- Coaxial cable
	- Copper wire
	- Optical fibre
	- Radio spectrum
- Different links can transmit data at different rate (transmission rate in bits/second)
- The sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment
	- Packets are send through the network to the destination
	- Reassembled to the original data
- Packet switch takes a packet forwards the packet from incoming to outgoing communication links

2 Types of Packet Switches
1) Routers
2) Link layer switches

- Both types forward packets to their destination
- Routers
	- Used in the network once
- Link layers
	- Used in access networks
- Sequence of links that is traversed by a packet is the route or path
- Cisco predicts annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte ($10^{21}$ bytes) by 2016
- End systems access the internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
	- Residential ISPs
		- Local cable
		- Telephone companies
	- Corporate ISPs
	- University ISPs
	- Public ISPs
		- WiFi
	- Cellular data ISPs
- Each ISP is a network of communication links and packet switches

- ISPs provides different types of networks
	- Residential broadband
		- Cable modem or DSL
		- High-speed LAN
		- Mobile wireless access
	- Content providers
		- Web and video servers

- Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs
- Upper-tier has a high-speed router with high-speed fibre-optic links
- Each ISP network is managed independently

Level 3 (Top-Tier) Communications
- AT&T
- Sprint
- NTT

- Internet runs protocols that control the sending and receiving of information
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are the two most important protocols in the internet
- IP
	- Specified the format of the packets
- TCP/IP
	- Collective internet principal protocols

- Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)
	- RFCs start as requests to resolve network and protocol design
	- Protocols such as
		- TCP
		- IP
		- HTTP
		- SMTP

### A Services Description

- Internet is also the infrastructure that provides services to application
	- Email
	- Web
	- Internet messaging
	- Mapping
	- Music streaming
	- Video streaming
	- Social networks
	- Multi-person games

- These application are distributed applications
- Internet application run on end systems
	- Not in the packet switched in network core

- End systems attached to the internet provide a socket interface that specifies how to deliver data from a source to a destination program
	- Set of rules
