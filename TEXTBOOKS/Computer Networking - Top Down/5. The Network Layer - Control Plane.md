- Control-plane component of network layer
	- Network wide logic that controls not only how a datagram is forwarded among routers, but also how network-layer components and services are configured and managed

- Traditionally, control-plane routing protocols have been implemented together with data-plane forwarding functions, monolithically, within a router
- Software-defined networking (SDN) makes a clear separation between the data and control planes

## Introduction

2 Possible Approaches to Forwarding
1. Per-routing control
2. Logically centralized control

- The controller interacts with a control agent (CA) in each of the routers via a well-defined protocol to configure and manage the router's flow table
- Google uses SDN to control the routers in its internal B4 global wide-area network
- SWAN, from Microsoft, uses a logically centralized controller to manage routing and forwarding between a wide area network and a data centre network

## Routing Algorithms

- A good path is one that has the least cost
- Routing algorithms that compute these paths are a fundamental importance
- Graph, $G = (N, E)$ is a set of $N$ nodes and a collection $E$ of edges, where each edge is a pair of nodes from $N$

- An edge cost may reflect the physical length, link speed, monetary cost
- A natural goal of routing algorithm is to identify the least costly paths between sources and destinations
- The least cost problem
	- Find a path between the source and destination that has the least cost
	- Also called the shortest path

Classifying Routing Algorithms
- Centralized
	- Least-cost path between source and destination using complete, global knowledge about the network
	- Algorithms with global state information are often referred to as link-state (LS) algorithm
- Decentralized
	- Least-cost path carried out in an iterative, distributed manner by the routers
	- Only knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links
	- Distance-vector (DV) algorithm

- Static
	- Routes change very slowly over time
	- Result of human intervention
- Dynamic
	- Change the routing paths as the network traffic loads or topology change
	- Run periodically or in direct response to topology or link cost changes

- Load-sensitive
	- Link costs vary dynamically to reflect the current level of congestion in the underlying link
- Load-insensitive
	- Link's cost does not explicitly reflect its current level of congestion
	- Used in todays internet


### The Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm

- Link-state broadcast algorithm
- Each node can run the LS algorithm and compute the same set of least-cost paths as every other node
- Dijkstra's algorithm
	- Related to Prim's algorithm
	- Computes the least-cost path from one node to all other nodes
	- Iterative and has the property that after the kth iteration, the least-cost paths are known

$D(v)$ - cost of the least-cost path from the source node to destination $v$ as of this iteration of the algorithm

$p(v)$ - previous node along the current least-cost path from the source to $v$

$N'$ - subnet of nodes


**Link-State (LS) Algorithm for Source node u**

```c
// Initialization
N' = {u}
	for all nodes v
		if v is a neightbour of u
			then D(v) = c(u, v)
				else D(v) = ∞

// Loop
	Find w not in N' such that D(w) is a minimum
	add w to N'
	update D(v) for each neighbour v of w and not in N':
		D(v) min(D(v), D(w) + c(w, v))
until N' = N
```
