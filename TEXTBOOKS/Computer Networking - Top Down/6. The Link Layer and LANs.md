- The network layer provides a communication service between any two network hosts
- Datagrams travel over communication links (wired and wireless) through packet switches (switches and routers)
- 2 different types of link-layer channels
	- Broadcast channels
		- Connect multiple hosts in wireless LANs, satellite networks, and hybrid fiber-coaxial cable (HFC) access networks
	- Point-to-point communication
		- Between two routers connected by a long distance link or Ethernet switch


## Introduction to the Link Layer

- A node is any device that runs a link layer protocol
	- Hosts, routers, switches, and WiFi access points
- Links are communication channels that connect adjacent nodes

Datagram Travel
1. WiFi link
2. Ethernet link
3. Link between link-layer switch and router
4. Link between the access point and link-layer switch
5. Link between router and link-layer switch
6. Ethernet link between switch and server

- A transmitting node encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame and transmits the frame into the link

### The Services Provided by the Link Layer

Services of a Link Layer Protocol
- Framing
	- A data field, in which the network layer datagram is inserted
	- A number of header fields
- Link access
	- Medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies in the rules by which a frame is transmitted onto the link
- Reliable delivery
- Error detection and correction

### Where Is the Link Layer Implemented?

- The link layer is implemented in the router's line card
- The link layer is implemented in a network adapter, also known as a network interface card (NIC)
	- Single purpose chip that implements link-layer services
	- Hardware
		- Intel's 710 adapter
		- Atheros AR5006
- Most NIC were separate cards the plug into the PCI slot
- Network adapters are now integrated onto the host's motherboard

- Controller takes a datagram that has been created and stored in hot memory by the higher layers of the protocol stack, encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame, then transmits the frame into the communication link
- Most of the link layer is implemented in hardware using host's CPI


## Error-Detection and Correction Techniques

- Bit-level error detection and correction
	- Detecting and correcting the corruption of bits in a link-layer frame send from one node to another physically connected neighbouring node
	- Often offered at the transport layer

- Node D is augmented with error-detection and correction bits (EDC)
- D and EDC are send to receiving node in link-level frame
- D' and EDC' is received
- 3 techniques for detecting erroes
	- Parity check
	- Checksumming
	- Cyclic redundancy checks

### Parity Check

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251227192021.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Even parity scheme
	- Include an additional bit for $d + 1$ bits
	- If an odd number is found for even, or vice versa, a bit error has occurred
	- Errors are often clustered together in "bursts"

- 2-dimensional generalization of the single-bit parity scheme
- Parity value is computer for each row and for each column
- The parity of both column and row containing the flipped bit will be in error
- The ability of the receiver to both detect and correct errors is known as forward error correction (FEC)
	- Audio storage
	- Playback devices such as audio CDs
- FEC decreased the number of sender retransmissions

### Checksumming Methods

- $d$ bits of data are treated as a sequence of $k$-bits integers
- Sum integers and use the resulting sum as the error detection bits
- Internet checksum
	- Bytes of data are treated as 16-bit integers and summer
	- 1s complement of sum forms the checksum in the segment header
- Transport layer is implemented in software and needs fast error-detection
- Link layer is implemented in dedicated hardware in adapters, which can rapidly perform more complex CRC operations

### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

- Today's computer networks is based on cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code
- CRC codes are also known as polynomial code
	- View bit string to be send as a polynomial whose coefficients are the 0 and 1 values
