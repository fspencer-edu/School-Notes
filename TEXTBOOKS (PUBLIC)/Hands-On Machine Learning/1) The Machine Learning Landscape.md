- Supervise vs. unsupervised learning
- Online vs. batch learning
- Instance-based vs. model-based learning


# Why Use Machine Learning?

- Machine learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data
- Each training set is a training instance/sample
- ML system that learns and makes prediction is the model
	- Neural networks
	- Random
