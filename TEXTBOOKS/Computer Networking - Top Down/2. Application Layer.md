## Principles of Network Applications

### Network Application Architectures

- Network application development is writing programs that run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network

- From application development, the network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications
- Application architecture is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured

- 2 Methods
	- Client-server
	- Peer-to-peer architecture

- Client-server architecture
	- Server is an always on host that services requests from the clients
	- Web server
	- Clients do no directly communicate with each other
	- Server has a fixed address (IP)
	- A client can always contact server
	- FTP
	- Telnet
	- Email
	- Single-server host is incapable of keeping up will all requests

- Data centres house large number of hosts to hand requests

- P2P architecture
	- Minimal or no reliance on dedicated servers in data centres
	- Applications uses direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers
	- Most of today's popular and traffic-intensive applications
	- File sharing
	- Self-scalability
		- Each peer also adds service capacity to the system by distributing files to other peers
	- Cost effective
	- Decentralized structure

### Processing Communicating

- A process is a program that is running within an end system
- Communicate with each other with interprocess communication
- Processes communicate with exchanging messages

**Client and Server Processes**
- A process can be both a client and server
- Process that initiates the communication is labeled the client
- The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the server

**Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network**
- The network through a software interface is called a socket
- Application Programming Interface (API) is the socket interface between the application layer and transport layer
- Application developer has control of everything on the application layer side, but little control of transport-layer
	- Choice of transport protocol
	- Ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and max segment sizes

**Addressing Processes**
- 2 pieces of information
	- Address of host
	- Identifier that specifies the receiving process in destination host

- Host is identified by its IP address
	- 32-bit number that uniquely identifies host
- A destination port number is used to identify receiving process
- Web server is identified by port number 89
- Mail server (SMTP) uses port 25


### Transport Services Available to Applications

- Transport layer protocol is responsible for getting messages to the socket of the receiving process

**Reliable Data Transfer**
- A packet can overflow a buffer in a router
- Can be discarded by a host or router for corrupted bits
- Process-to-process reliable data transfer, passes data into the socket with complete confidence that data will arrive without errors
- Loss-tolerant applications, such as multimedia has some amount of data loss

**Throughput**

- Other sessions share the bandwidth along the network path, the available throughput can fluctuate with time
- If the transport protocol cannot provide throughput, application needs to encode at a lower rate or give up half of data
- Applications have requirements that are bandwidth-sensitive
- Elastic applications can make use of as much, or as little, throughput available

**Timing**
- A transport-layer protocol can also provide timing guarantees
- Real-time application
- Telephone
- Virtual environments
- Multiplayer games

**Security**
- A transport protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process
- Receiving host decrypts data
- Also provide confidentiality, including data integrity and end-point authentication

### Transport Services Provided by the Internet

**TCP Services**
- The TCP service model includes a connection-oriented service and a reliable data transfer service
- Connection oriented service
	- Client and server transport layer control information before application level message flow
	- Handshaking allows to prepare for packet transfer
	- TCP connection exists between the sockets of the two processes
	- Full-duplex connection
		- Can send messages over the same connection at the same time
	- Application tears down connection when finished
- Reliable data transfer service
	- TCP delivers all data send without error and in proper order
- Congestion control mechanisms

**UDP Services**
- Lightweight transport protocol
- Minimal services
- Connectionless, no handshaking before processes communicate
- Unreliable data transfer service
- No guarantee for message arrival
- No congestion control mechanism

#### FOCUS ON SECURITY

- Neither TCP or UDP provides encryption
- Applications use secure sockets layer (SSL)
- TCP-enhanced-with-SSL provides critical process-to-process security
	- Encryption
	- Data integrity
	- End-point authentication
- SSL has its own socket API

**Services Not Provided by Internet Transport Protocols**
- TCP is primarily used because is provide reliable data transfer, and guaranteed delivery
- Phone use UDP, circumventing TCP congestion control mechanism and packet overheads
	- Use TCP as backup

### Application-Layer Protocols

- An application layer protocol define how an application's processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other

Defines:
- Types of messages exchanged
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds

- Some application layer protocols are specified in RFCs and are public domain
	- HTTP

### Network Applications Covered in This Book

- Applications
	- Web
	- Mail
	- Directory service video streaming
	- P2P

## The Web and HTTP

- The Web was the first internet application in the general public
- Web operates on demand
- Hyperlinks and search engines help to navigate

### Overview of HTTP

- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Web's application-layer protocol, is the heart of the Web
- Client and server program, execute on different end systems
	- Talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages
- A Web page consists of objects
- An objects is simply a file that is addressable by a single URL
	- HTML
	- Images
	- Java applet
	- Video clip
	- Most web pages consist of a base HTML file and referenced objects

- Web browsers implement the client side of HTTP
- Web servers implement the server side of HTTP
	- Apache
	- Microsoft Internet Information Server
- HTTP uses TCP

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20251212190525.png" alt="image" width="500">

- Server sends requested files to client without storing any state information about the client
	- Server resends the objects
- HTTP is a stateless protocol
- A Web server is always on, with a fixed IP address

### Non-Persistent and Persistent Connections

- Non-persistent connections
	- Request-response pair over a separate TCP connection
- Persistent connections
	- Requests-response at the same time

- HTTP uses persistent connections in its default mode

**HTTP with Non-Persistent Connections**
- Base HTML with 10 image

1) HTTP client process initiates a TCP connection to the server on port 80
2) The HTTP client sends an HTTP request message to the server via its socket
	1) Request message include path name
3) HTTP server process receives the request message
	1) Retrieves the objects from storage, encapsulates it, and responds with a message to client
4) HTTP server tells TCP to close TCP connection
5) HTTP client receives the response message
	1) TCP connection terminates
6) First four steps are repeated for each references image object
